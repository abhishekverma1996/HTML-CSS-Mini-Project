# Parallax PhotoGraphy Site

This is a script that makes it easy for you to set up a site that uses parallax scrolling as its main effect. A parallax site concists of items in different layers that move with different speeds, to give the illusion of depth.




## How it works


The script is controlled mostly from HTML and CSS. You specify layers in your markup and position them in CSS. You set HTML5 data attributes on each layer to let the script know about them. That is also where you specify the speed for the layer.
